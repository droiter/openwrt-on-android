## How to build android openwrt ipk.
1. git clone git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git

3. ./scripts/feeds install –a
4. Overwrite openwrt source code with files in "build" directory

## Security issues

1. Security is traded for convenience, all account password is initialized as "root“ and "asdf1234" in login/wifi/samba/mysqld etc.
2. Please change the password, or use it with your own risk.
3. There's a cron background job try to update everyday, you might stop it
